    <p> Hi! I'm Alexandre Kaiser, welcome to my website. I am currently a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Courant. if you are seeing this on Wednesday the 6th of December, I apologize but I will finish this website by the end of the day. I'm very sorry</p>
    <h2>Current work</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Alexandre Kaiser, and here's a brief introduction about myself...</p>
    <<h2>Research Interests</h2>

    <p>My research interests lie particularly in the role of optimization on a modelâ€™s implicit bias and scaling properties, thus how features and symmetries develop in deep learning models. This includes research on how the loss surface lends itself to emergent behavior in practice. Though my research is theoretical, I am motivated by a desire to improve the usefulness of algorithms in practice. Agnostic to the task or even its modalities, I aim to improve our understanding of deep learning models to better predict their behavior in real-world applications. </p>
