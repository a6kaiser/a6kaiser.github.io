        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h2>Applied Mathematics and Philosophy</h2>
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The following is an abstract reflection of my personal motivations as well as my thought processes around it. I will sometimes stretch the definition of a technical term to relate it to common ideas.</p>
        <p>I am motivated to improve the usefulness of algorithms on future tasks. The subtleties of that statement are the choice of “usefulness” which is purposefully subjective, which empowers us to challenge the choice of particular metrics and objectives, and also highlights that theory serves empirical validation, not the other way around (as Sabine Hossenfelder has said, “your math isn’t real”). The other choice is “future tasks”. There is no point in fitting past data if it does poorly in the future, that is because the past is history so we can’t go back and make use of our algorithm in the past. </p>
        <p>Here is a graph as a visual aid</p>
        <p>For those with a finance background you may have noticed that I adapted the DCF model to form the basis of my motivation. Whereas finance defines value as the expected future free cash flows discounted by the opportunity cost of capital, here I generalize the expected discounted cash flows to be "usefulness". In this way, value is defined as future usefulness. So I am saying that I am motivated to make algorithms more valuable. The analogy is extra fitting because the DCF is limited to past data to predict the future cash flows, similarly to how machine learning studies how to best utilize past data to make future predictions.</p>
